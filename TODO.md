Functionality
=============

[ ] Integration with external linear algebra libraries and solvers.
[ ] Automagically detect .kern inclusion and nvcc to generate needed CUDA obj files.
[ ] - Removes need for ugly FMMTL_KERNEL_EXTRAS macro.
[ ] Kernel-specific MACs. Static and Dynamic versions.
[ ] - Optimization of traversals and algorithms based on static and/or dynamic choices.
[ ] Python interface
[ ] Fast ND Gauss transform.
[ ] Integrate Helmholtz kernel.

==Applications==
[ ] NBody demo example.
[ ] BEM Kernel and example (from previous repo).
[x] Visualization of 2D kernel error.

Performance
===========

[ ] Cached-optimal and communication-optimal distributed p2p library.
[ ] Optimization of A2B algorithms in the case of unused arguments.

Maintenance
===========

[ ] More logging and better logging structure/style
[ ] Means of easily tracking/plotting heap memory usage over time

Documentation
=============

[ ] Improved use of DEBUG_ONLY macro
[ ] Use #pragma once and #define fences
